# Automated tests - Selenium Shop
Yes... Selenium shop, but I've done it in Playwright framework ðŸ¥‡

# About this project
First of all, I needed to get to know the application. That's why I used exploratory testing. <p>
Next step was creating test plan and test scenarios/test cases. <p>
Finally I could prepare my automation tests.
